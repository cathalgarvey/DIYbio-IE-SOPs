# GMP/GOSH Handout for Training/Lab Admin
## Section 1 – GMP and GOSH Guidelines
* Keeping the workplace and environmental exposure to any GMMs to the lowest practicable level.
* Exercising engineering control measures at source and supplementing these where necessary with protective clothing and equipment.
* Testing and maintaining control measures and equipment.
* Testing where necessary for the presence of viable GMMs outside containment.
* Providing appropriate training of personnel.
* Establishing biological safety committees where needed.
* Formulating and implementing local codes of practice for the safety of personnel.
* Displaying biohazard signs where appropriate.
* Providing washing and decontamination facilities.
* Keeping adequate records.
* Prohibiting eating, drinking, smoking, cosmetic application, food storage in the work area.
* Prohibiting mouth pippetting.
* Providing written SOPs where required.
* Providing effective disinfectants and disinfection SOPs to cater to spillages of GMMs.
* Providing safe storage for contaminated equipment/materials.

## Section 2 – GMP and GOSH for Visitors/Staff
Much of the guidelines are for administrators to address; creating and providing SOPs and facilities for washing, decontamination, cleanup etc. However, some are of particular note to visitors and staff at GMM facilities. These are:

* Keeping the workplace and environmental exposure to any GMMs to the lowest practicable level.
    * Don't handle GMMs unless you need to.
    * Don't leave GMMs outside of storage when not in use.
    * Observe good microbiology practices; proper waste & glove disposal, glassware sterilisation, waste sterilisation.
* Exercising engineering control measures at source and supplementing these where necessary with protective clothing and equipment.
    * Wear protective gloves and a lab coat, do not remove from the lab.
    * Prepare your experiments before undertaking them in order to maximise tidiness.
    * Develop good habits; seal vessels when not in use, don't leave close to table edges..
* Testing and maintaining control measures and equipment.
    * Always use indicators when autoclaving to ensure a good cycle.
    * Use negative control cultures to ensure sterile culture.
    * Swab surfaces and culture/PCR occasionally to check for GMMs.
* Testing where necessary for the presence of viable GMMs outside containment.
    * Swabs of floors, clothing, hands, shoes -> PCR array with GMM-specific primers.
    * Identify possible routes of escape, and test along these routes.
* Keeping adequate records.
    * Autoclave inactivations of GMM-contaminated materials: Date, name, type, result.
    * Sampling of stock cultures, deposition of new cultures.
    * Dates, Names, Types of persons visiting for training.
* Prohibiting eating, drinking, smoking, cosmetic application, food storage in the work area.
    * This is a microbiology lab. We grow E.coli, FFS. Hands away from faces!
* Prohibiting mouth pippetting.
    * Not only a risk to your person, but a risk to containment and to your experiment. NO.

## Section 3 – Irish EPA Requirements: Class 1 Labs
The EPA provides specific guidelines on lab construction and equipment for each class level. For Class 1 labs, the mandatory and optional requirements are as follows. All optional requirements have been marked as *mandatory* in Indie Biotech's license condtions.

* Mandatory Requirements:
    * Bench to be resistant to water, acids, alkali, solvents, disinfectants, decontamination agents. Bench must be easy to clean.
    * Autoclave “On Site”; as in, on the same property. Maintained in lab by default.
    * “Suitable Protective Clothing” - Lab Coat, Gloves.
* Optional Requirements: (mandatory for Indie Biotech)
    * Efficient rodent/insect control measures.
    * Inactivation of GMM contaminated materials and waste before disposal.
    * Observation window or alternative to enable occupants to be seen.
* Special Requirements that are mandatory for Indie Biotech:
    * Must use actual biological spore strips to test Autoclave monthly.
    * Must notify emergency services of lab location and nature.
    * Must establish a biological safety committee.
    * SOPs detailing the following must be written/kept/displayed:
        * Training of staff or students
        * Treatment of spillages with disinfectants
        * Cleaning and disinfection of equipment
        * Transport & Storage of GMMs within the laboratory/building.
        * Operation, testing and maintenance of containment equipment (particularly the autoclave).
        * Measures for limiting access to the GMM facility.
        * Treatment and Disposal of GMM waste.
        * Risk Assessment Procedures.
        * GMM Identification and Characterisation.
    * Maintenance of records and logbooks for:
        * Students or Staff attending for training.
        * Student/Staff training records.
        * Inactivation events (autoclave usage, spill cleanup).
        * Storage of GMM stocks.
    * Biohazard sign on fridge door (to discourage keeping food-for-eating there).
    * Sign on outer door indicating that this is a lab. Inside door to remain locked.
    * Sign indicating handwashing facility.
    * Must notify EPA of commencement date, license extends only 1 year from that date (??)
    * Persons may only be allowed to interact with GMMs once they have finished training.
