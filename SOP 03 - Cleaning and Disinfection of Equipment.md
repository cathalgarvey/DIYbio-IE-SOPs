# S.O.P. Detailing Cleaning and Disinfection of Equipment
## Preamble
Equipment that is to be used with GMM materials must be designed to withstand routine sterilisation. Stereilisation methods must be appropriate to the task of GMM inactivation, and must be appropriately applied in all cases.

## Aims
To detail methods of efficient sterilisation that can be applied to equipment, including equipment too large to autoclave, in order to maintain effective containment of GMMs.

## Protocol
1. Equipment should be used to minimise initial exposure to GMMs, reducing dependence on equipment disinfection:
    - Fridge should only be used to store sealed vessels containing GMMs. Saran wrap or Ziploc bags should be used to seal petri dishes and loose-cap test tubes. GMM cultures should only be kept in the lowest container in the fridge.
    - Freezer cultures should be securely stored in a ziploc bag, then a hard box or case, and labelled using a freezer-proof marker, before being placed inside.
    - The incubator must have an intact plastic lining, to prevent adsorbtion of liquids or aerosols to the walls of the incubator.
    - The autoclave should be kept out of the microbiology area of the lab. Best practice is always observed to minimise risks of glassware breakage, aerosolation, or insufficient heat delivery to contents.
    - Bunsen flames are not allowed to contact liquid or solid culture media before said media have dried above the flame, to minimise the chances of flash-boiling and aerosolation of cultures.
    - If porous surfaces form part of equipment, they must be sealed; wooden surfaces should be sealed using oil or varnish, polystyrenes should be coated in vinyl sheeting or other plastic, and stonewear should be sealed with a varnish, glue or other chemically resistant surfacing agent to render them imporous.
2. To clean up after use, metal equipment is sterilised with commercial sterilants such as dettol. Bleach is avoided as it may pit metals and decrease efficiency of subsequent sterilisations. Metal is then doused in alcohol to offer additional sterilant activity and to remove residual dettol.
3. Rubber components are removed if possible and soaked briefly in dettol. Alcohol is avoided as it may render rubber gaskets brittle, reducing efficiency of pressure vessels such as autoclaves.
4. Components with complex shapes (such as the autoclave weight-float) are soaked in alcohol, as surface tension of water based sterilants may prevent penetration to the interior.
5. Plastic equipment is sterilised using dettol with an appropriate contact time, followed by a rapid alcohol rinse. Contact time is minimised to preserve plastic surfaces.
6. Wooden equipment, if used, is bleached in fresh percarbonate bleach for 30 minutes and then rinsed in water to remove bleach.
7. Bench surfaces are cleaned routinely with alcohol spray, typically isopropyl alcohol at 70% with tap water. They are also cleaned daily with dettol, observing appropriate contact times.
8. Floor surfaces are washed weekly with a floor disinfectant solution using a mop. The mop-head is occasionally sterilised further using percarbonate bleach solution.
9. Electrical equipment in need of cleaning is cleaned using a damp cloth containing dettol solution. If sterilisation of actual electrical circuitboards is required, it will be attained by submerging circuits in mineral oil to protect them from moisture and subjecting them to an autoclave cycle.
10. Glassware and small equipment is sterilised either by autoclave or by dry heat.
    - Autoclave cycles for equipment surfaces are 20 minutes at full pressure, without forced cooling, with lids loose or absent.
    - Dry heat cycles consist of 1hr 30 mins at 200C in an oven, typically with glassware wrapped in aluminium foil to retain sterility thereafter. Oven is loaded cold, brought to heat with the door sealed shut, and then cooled after a full cycle without opening in order to reduce risk of glass shattering.

## Verification
Microbial swabbing is used to validate sterilisation. Swabs are used to sample for GMM microbes using selective plates where appropriate or by PCR analysis of colonies grown on nonselective plates.
