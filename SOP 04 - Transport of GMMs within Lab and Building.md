# S.O.P. Detailing Transport and Storage of GMMs within Lab and Building
# Preamble
Most foreseeable hazards to containment occur during routine handling and storage of GMMs. This SOP lays out best-practise guidelines for handling and storage to minimise these risks to the lowest practicable level.

# Aims
To minimise the risk of spillage, exposure or transfer outside containment of GMMs during handling and storage.

# Protocol
1. Stored cultures are to be maintained only within designated containers in the fridge, freezer on on the bench. These containers should have a lock and should not be opened without lab manager consent. The lock must be kept closed and the keys kept only by authorised personnel.
2. Stored cultures must be individually sealed within lock-boxes. If cultures are spore-forming bacteria, they should be stored as sporulated cultures at room temperature. If cultures are non-spore-forming, they should be stored in glycerol/microbead tubes, sealed, at -20. Agar stab cultures can be maintained in the fridge box, but must remain sealed; obligate aerobic cultures are inappropriate for this storage format.
3. When handling GMMs for any reason, gloves and a lab coat must be worn. Long hair should be tied back. Dangling clothing, such as baggy sleeves or ties, must not be worn.
4. Stock cultures should be removed from the box as follows; the storage box should be removed, upright at all times, from the fridge, freezer or bench lock-box and placed on the bench. The lock should be unsealed, and the needed culture(s) removed. If cultures are to be used as-is, the box should be sealed, then placed back in the fridge/freezer/desktop lockbox and returned to the usual position. The removed cultures should be kept at all times upright in a rack to improve stability. If cultures are only to be used to inoculate a new culture, they should be immediately used to do so, and then returned to the box, sealed, and returned to the lock-box in the usual place.
5. Cultures should be transported with lids sealed, or with plates sealed with saran wrap or masking tape. Tubes of any scale should be contained in a rack to improve stability, plates should be stacked ant taped together with masking tape or saran wrap. Transport should be direct, planned and minimised.

# Verification
If spillages or exposure occurs, it should be cleaned up according to the relevant SOP, and a log entry made. If exposure outside the containment area occurs, the EPA must be notified in addition to normal decontamination guidelines.
