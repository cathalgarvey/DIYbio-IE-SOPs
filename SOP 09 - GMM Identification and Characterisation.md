# S.O.P. 9: Detailing the Identification of GMM Strains
## Preamble
In order to better identify whether an organism detected within the lab or the lab surrounds is an escaped GMM organism, it is necessary to have tested procedures for the detection of such strains on-hand. The usual method is PCR using primers that produce a product of known size.

Note: If a sample is sufficiently suspicious to merit testing for GMM status, it may be prudent to sterilise the sampled area _before_ continuing with verification, just in case.

## Aims
To detail design parameters for PCR verification procedures.

## Protocol
1. DNA that is designed for use in the lab should be designed to include an easily amplifiable sequence using primers designed for this purpose, or using pre-validated primers such as M17 sequencing primers. Pre-validated primers are preferred for environmental sampline, as they can be used generally to detect GMMs rather than having to use multiple primer pairs.
2. The primer sets should be tested on DNA before it is used to transform bacteria. The primers should also be tested for false-positive results in the recipient strain before transformation, and optionally on other species and on environmental DNA samples.
3. The size of the amplicon should be compared to the expected size. If the primers function as intended, they can be used thereafter to test for the presence of the GMM in samples.
4. If a sample unexpectedly turns up results on a routine PCR, the sample should be studied further to ensure that it is not a false positive.
    - At least, this should involve sending the PCR result for sequencing.
    - If a microbiological sample was used, the isolate should be assayed for the presence of plasmids and should be tested for antibiotic resistance or any other measurable phenotype matching any of the potentially detected plasmids or DNA sequences in use.
5. If a result is found and verified to have been a GMM isolate, the results may call for further action; if the isolate was found within the lab, then sterilisation procedures may have to improve.
    - If the amplified produce resulted from a direct swab rather than a microbiological isolate, isolation on selective media should be attempted from the location from which the original sample was taken. If this is not possible, then naked DNA may be to blame, and measures to destroy free DNA may need to be implemented.
    - If the isolate was from a microbiological sample, then sterilisation procedures need to be improved to improve containment. Further tests should be performed outside the containment area, to ensure that escape from containment has not occurred.
6. If further investigation reveals that escape from containment has occurred, all current work must be suspended and the EPA notified immediately. With consent from the EPA, measures to sterilise the surrounding area outside the lab should be undertaken; surface spraying with bleach solution may be employed to sterilise walls, windows and slabs or tiling in the surrounding area.


## Verification
Potential results should always be corroborated by a second PCR if possible using different primers, or if this is not possible then a sequencing reaction should be performed on the PCR product immediately to determine whether it is a real or spurious amplicon.
