# S.O.P. 10: Detailing the Maintenance and Presentation of Logbooks
## Preamble
Accurate logs are a legal requirement. Some logs may also serve a practical role as a basis for comparison with past events or measurements. Consistency is nearly as important as accuracy in logkeeping; this SOP will detail required information for a log entry in each case.

## Aims
To keep note of required logs, and to detail the format and content of log entries expected.

All digital logs should be kept as .csv documents. If signatures are required, they should be kept as digitally signed images overlayed upon printed documents.

## Logs and Content
1. “Persons Attending the facility for purposes of training and details of their respective affiliations.” A digital log should be kept as follows:
    - Date
    - Name
    - Age
    - Affiliations (if any)
    - Time Entering the Lab
    - Time Exiting the Lab
    - Training Undertaken 
2. “Any changes to the GMO Register Entry, corresponding risk assessment and/or containment measures applied.” A digital logbook should be kept of new entries as follows:
    - Date
    - Project Title
    - Name of Recipient Strain
    - Altered Genotype
    - Expected/Desired Phenotype
    - Location of Relevant Sequence Information
    - Location of Risk Assessment Documentation
    - Biological Safety Committee Vetted (Yes/No)
3. “Changes in waste disposal procedures and dates on which inactivation validation procedures were carried out during the report year.” A digital logbook should be kept with one entry per inactivation validation test. The format should be as follows:
    - The date
    - The model validated, and its capacity in liters.
    - The time that heat was applied to the locked system.
    - The time that the system reached full pressure.
    - The time that the heat was removed or disabled.
    - Timepoints over 48 hours for checking the test culture and negative control culture.
    - Whether growth was ultimately observed in the test culture.
    - Whether growth was observed in the negative control sample.
    - Changes to autoclave procedures should be given individual pages, detailing the relevant changes and the reasoning behind such changes, with reference to validation pages where these played a role in informing the change.
5. “Storage of GMM Stock Material.” A digital logbook should be kept for strain storage in the following format:
    - Location of the material
    - Strain identifier of the recipient strain
    - Genetic changes made to the recipient strain
    - Altered phenotype
    - Any special Storage considerations
6. “GMM Inactivation Events”
    - A digital logbook is kept as detailed in SOP 7.
7. “Training Records for Staff or Trainees that use, encounter or are associated with GMM contained use activities.”
    - A digital logbook is kept as detailed in SOP 1.
8. “Accidents or Incidents”
    - A digital logbook is kept in the following format:
    - The date
    - The location of the accident or incident
    - The nature of the accident or incident
    - Measures taken to resolve the accident or incident
    - Validation measures taken to ensure full resolution
    - Suggested changes (if any) to regular protocol to prevent in future
    - Any additional notes

## Verification
Logs are presented to the EPA on request or as part of a yearly report. Logs are also presented to the biosafety committee.
