# S.O.P. Detailing Measures for Limiting Facility Access
## Preamble
In order to ensure compliance with SOPs, Lab best-practice and containment regulations, only those who are authorised to enter the lab must be able to do so. The following methods detail ways of limiting lab access and ensuring that access is limited to authorised personnel.

## Aims
To limit access to authorised persons only, and to ensure no other individuals access the lab.

## Protocol
1. The inside door to the lab is locked at all times.
2. The outer door to the lab is locked when the lab is unoccupied.
3. A sign on the door indicates that the lab is restricted to authorised persons only.
4. The lock on the inside door is blocked by a partially turned key to prevent keyholder access from the other side.
5. Outside business hours, the lab is monitored by time-lapse video surveillance, when the required hardware is operational.

## Verification
Locks are monitored and maintained to ensure there is no tampering. Footage from the time-lapse video system is observed regularly to ensure there was no unauthorised access.
