# S.O.P. 7: Detailing Treatment and Disposal of GMM Waste
## Preamble
Outgoing waste is a primary vector for GMM escape from containment. While there is little risk of lab strains surviving or competing outside of a containment lab, sterilisation before disposal is nevertheless required to ensure complete containment.

## Aims
To lay out means of disposing of different types and volumes of GMM-contaminated waste.

## Protocol
1. For waste of a low enough volume to fit safely in the autoclave/pressure cooker, see 7A.
2. For large volumes of liquid waste, see 7B.
3. Large volumes of solid, gel or agar waste should be partitioned and treated acc. to 7A.
4. Once any waste product is adequately sterilised, it is suitable for final disposal according to its type. Final disposal should be delayed until validation of sterilisation, if necessary, is complete.
    - Liquid wastes not containing noxious chemicals can be disposed of by drainage.
    - Solid wastes or gel wastes not containing noxious chemicals can be disposed of through regular refuse disposal.
    - Any wastes containing controlled or otherwise noxious chemicals should be disposed of by a contracted waste collector.
5. A digital logbook should be kept in the following format:
    - Date
    - Inactivation format
    - Approximate waste volume
    - GMM contents of waste
    - Person performing sterilisation

## Verification
Individual procedures are presented in each case for validation of sterilisation.

# S.O.P. 7A: Detailing Correct Usage of Autoclave Pressure Cooker
## Preamble
Sterilisation is achieved by applying temperatures in excess of 120 Celsius by building pressure, and maintaining this temperature and pressure for at least 30 minutes.

## Aims
To correctly load, employ and unload the pressure cooker. To validate cycles monthly and per-use.

## Protocol
1. Begin by adding tap water to the pressure cooker to a depth of 6cm.
2. Load with items to be sterilised. Items should be placed no higher than lip of the cooker.
    - Vessels must not be sealed; steam must penetrate during use.
    - Plasticware & disposables should be wrapped in heat-resistant bags.
3. Apply autoclave indicator tape to the largest items and to liquid containers below the liquid line, so that the tape is cooled by the liquid inside and reflects inner temperature.
4. If required or desired, add a live indicator such as freshly inoculated spores or an exhausted Bacillus culture for later streaking and incubation.
5. Check the lid gasket for signs of wear or damage, then fit within the lid and fit the lid on.
6. Lock the lid in place and turn the heat on to full on the 1.5KW heat plate.
7. Await a steady stream of steam and leave to equilibriate. Venting steam should be even.
8. Apply the weighted float to the spout and leave for pressure to build.
9. Once pressurised steam starts to vent from around the float, start counting 30m.
10. If there are items with a large thermal mass or convoluted volume, leave for 35m.
11. After the requisite time, turn off the heat source.
12. Leave to cool naturally. Do not force-cool or vent steam manually.
13. Once cool, it is safe to open; the contents should be sterile.
14. Verification of sterility may be necessary, see below.
15. Waste contents should be bagged and retained until verified to be sterile.
16. Non-chemical waste may be disposed of through conventional routes once verified.

## Verification
If using indicator tape, check that the tape has changed to show black stripes, indicating correct cycle. Liquid or solid waste may be sampled on rich media against a negative control to check for viability.

If using an additional spore culture, either:

1. Inoculate a fresh test tube with spores, then sterilise it and incubate it at permissive temperature.
2. Streak spores on a fresh agar plate, then sterilise it and incubate at a permissive temperature.

Incubation should be 30C for 48h if using B.subtilis, or 50C for 48h if using G.stearothermophilus If no growth is observed, then the contents of that sterilisation cycle may be considered sterilised.

# S.O.P. 7B: Detailing Treatment and Disposal of Larger Liquid Waste Volumes
## Preamble
The usual method of liquid waste inactivation is to mix the liquid waste with hypochlorite bleach or peroxide-based bleach to a known active concentration of active bleach (normally 10%), and to then leave the bleach act upon the waste for a defined contact period.

## Aims
To lay out a protocol for correct mixing of bleach agents and liquid waste, including appropriate contact time and subsequent disposal routes.

## Protocol
1. All equipment and containers used in this protocol must be suitable for sterilisation using standard methods. This means tools must be small enough to be autoclaved, or they must be chemically resistant and therefore possible to sterilise by immersion in 10% bleach overnight.
2. Liquid waste that contains substantial or sizeable suspended particles should be filtered to remove these particles, which should be separately treated according to 7A. This is to prevent pockets of solid waste escaping contact sterilisation by bleach.
3. Liquid waste of unknown volume can be weighed, and the volume estimated at 1.1ml/g in order to give a conservative estimate. The weight of all waste containers should be known and labelled in advance.
4. To this volume of waste, sufficient hypochlorite bleach solution is added to give a final concentration of 10%. This is carefully stirred to ensure proper mixing using a rod that can be separately sterilised (for example, a glass pippette).
5. This bleach solution is allowed to work overnight, or for at least 12 hours, before disposal. For waste without a gel or polymer component, disposal may be by domestic liquid waste routes. For waste with a partial gel component that might block or damage liquid waste routes, waste may be disposed of by a waste contracting company.
6. Any tools or containers used in the protocol are also sterilised by appropriate means.

## Verification
Before final disposal, samples may be streaked under sterile conditions on rich media. Negative controls should be used to ensure that any growth observed is verifiably derived from the liquid waste rather than experimental error.
