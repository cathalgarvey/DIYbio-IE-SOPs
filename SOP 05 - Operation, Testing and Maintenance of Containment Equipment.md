# S.O.P. 5 AA: Detailing Correct Usage of Autoclave Pressure Cooker
## Preamble
Sterilisation of media, tools and glassware is critical to removing unforseen variables from experiments involving GMMs. Sterilisation of waste is likewise critical, but is detailed in SOP 7 and differs in practice.

Sterilisation is achieved by applying temperatures in excess of 120 Celsius by building pressure, and maintaining this temperature and pressure for at least 20 minutes.

## Aims
To correctly load, employ and unload the pressure cooker. To validate cycles monthly and per-use.

## Protocol
1. Begin by adding tap water to the pressure cooker to a depth of 6cm.
2. Load carefully with items to be sterilised. Items should be placed no higher than the lip of the cooker.
    - Vessels must not be sealed; steam must penetrate during use.
    - Plasticware & disposables should be wrapped in heat-resistant bags.
    - Glassware or other items that must remain sterile should be foil-wrapped.
3. Apply autoclave indicator tape to the largest items and to liquid containers below the liquid line, so that the tape is cooled by the liquid inside and reflects inner temperature.
4. If required or desired, add a live indicator such as freshly inoculated spores or an exhausted Bacillus culture for later streaking and incubation.
5. Check the lid gasket for signs of wear or damage, then fit within the lid and fit the lid on.
6. Lock the lid in place and turn the heat on to full on the 1.5KW heat plate.
7. Await a steady stream of steam and leave to equilibriate. Venting steam should be even.
8. Apply the weighted float to the spout and leave for pressure to build.
9. Once pressurised steam starts to vent from around the float, start counting 20m. If there are items with a large thermal mass or convoluted volume, leave for 25m. (unless sterilising waste, in which case longer times are used: refer to SOP 7A).
10. After the requisite time, turn off the heat source.
11. Leave to cool naturally. Do not force-cool or vent steam manually.
12. Once cool, it is safe to open; the contents should be sterile. To maintain sterility, close  lids before storage.
13. Verification of sterility may be necessary, see below.

## Verification
If using indicator tape, check that the tape has changed to show black stripes, indicating correct cycle.
1. Inoculate a fresh test tube with spores, then sterilise it and incubate it at permissive temperature.
2. Streak spores on a fresh agar plate, then sterilise it and incubate at a permissive temperature.

Incubation should be 30C for 48h if using B.subtilis, or 50C for 48h if using G.stearothermophilus If no growth is observed, then the contents of that sterilisation cycle may be considered sterilised.

Incubation of a sample of media, whether broth or agar, may be beneficial to ensure sterility.

If samples contained “hard water”, a precipitate may form within 5/6 hours of cooling and may settle as sediment to the bottom of the containers. This should be distinguished from unintended growth or contamination; if there is doubt, samples should be streaked on agar and observed for growth.

# S.O.P. 5 AB Detailing Correct Testing of Autoclave Pressure Cooker
## Preamble
Testing of the autoclave is achieved through use of viable Bacillus spores, which are cultured before and after cycling through the autoclave in order to test the autoclave for reliable sterilisation. Logs of such routine tests are kept. If a test is failed, the autoclave is examined for fault, repaired if fault is found, or replaced, and re-tested before proceeding with work.

## Aims
- To test the efficacy of the autoclave cycle in use.
- To isolate problems as they arise and identify problems with the autoclave or cycle in use.
- To accurately log and record processes and outcomes of testing operations.

## Protocol
1. Spores of Geobacillus stearothermophilus are prepared by growing a culture to exhaustion in rich broth at 50C for three days, standing.
2. Spores are collected by centrifugation under sterile conditions, and resuspended in cold rich broth at a 10x Dilution factor from the starting culture. These are stored for use in validation.
3. When validation is required, two prepared cultures of spores in rich broth are used; one as a negative control, and another for validating the autoclave.
4. The test sample is placed in the autoclave and the cycle performed as normal. The negative control is instead left at room temperature.
5. After autoclaving is finished, the test and negative control samples are incubated together at 50C for 48 hours.
6. If after 48 hours there are signs of turbid growth in the test sample, the autoclave cycle is deemed to have failed, and recent waste batches that were autoclaved according to the same protocol are subjected to additional sterilisation.
7. If after 48 hours the test sample shows no growth (and the negative control does show signs of growth), waste inactivated according to the standard protocol can be considered inactivated, and the autoclave can be considered operational as normal.

## Verification
Logs are kept and observed for changes in outcome compared with changed parameters. If testing is performed on different volumes and different outcomes are observed, then sterilisation parameters must change to reflect the volume of sterilised samples.


# S.O.P. 5 AC Detailing Correct Maintanence of Autoclave Pressure Cooker
## Preamble
The pressure-cooker has few joints or parts that may require maintenance, but these must be observed on a regular basis for signs of wear. In particular, the pressure gasket and the weight-float need to be checked for signs of damage, and must be replaced if they show signs of wear.

## Aims
To observe for damage, take preventative measures against wear, and to repair or replace the gasket and float on the pressure-cooker.

## Protocol
1. The gasket in the pressure-cooker lid should be removed and checked on both sides for wear.
2. Forms of gasket wear include:
    - Flakiness or roughness of the rubber material
    - Changes in colour or texture of the rubber
    - Tears, pits or fractures of the rubber
3. If the gasket is in good condition, it should be rubbed down with mineral or vegetable oil occasionally in order to keep the surface strong, and to improve the seal formed with the lid.
4. The metal float should be observed for the following signs of wear:
    - Rust or oxidation,
    - Changes in balance or weight
    - As directed by the manufacturer's guidelines for maintenance
5. The metal float should be checked for blockages in any of the venting holes or the primary steam shaft, and any blockages carefully removed. During washing, these holes should be washed with a pipet brush, and dried afterwards by soakage and rinsing with alcohol to prevent rusting.
6. If the float or gasket show signs of wear, they should be replaced immediately.

## Verification
Verification of proper function detailed in 5AB.



# S.O.P. 5BA Detailing Proper Usage of Bunsen Burners or HEPA Filters
## Preamble
Maintaining sterility in a zone of work requires equipment that sterilises surrounding air or creates an environment in which contamination is unlikely, such as an updraft. For this, Bunsen Burners or HEPA-filtered air are typical solutions.

## Aims
- To outline the proper usage of bunsen burners.
- Separately, to outline the proper usage of HEPA-filtered airflow hoods.

## Protocol
1. Bunsen burners are thought to provide an area of virtual sterility, either by creating a powerful updraft which prevents sedimentation of contaminants or by establishing a zone of cyclic air currents which have been sterilised by passing through the flame.
    - In order to maximise this zone, the bunsen should be tuned to a strong, blue flame.
    - Work should be conducted conservatively within 10 centimeters of the flame.
    - Metal tools may be sterilised by flaming until glowing, then allowing to cool near the flame.
         - When flaming tools after exposure to GMM materials, tools should be dried above the flame before sterilisation within the flame, to prevent flash-boiling and potential atomisation of GMM material.
    - Glass tools such as spreaders may be alcohol-sterilised, then dried by flaming carefully.
    - Work time should be kept to a minimum; efficiently planned steps minimise odds of contamination by manual mistakes or by imperfect air currents.
2. HEPA-filtration can provide air that is sterile or close to sterile, particularly if the air is partially cycled repeatedly through the filtration unit. Ideally, the airflow is contained partially in a flow-hood, although a direct airflow system will also work adequately.
    - Before use, the air filter should be allowed to run for five minutes, in order to allow any internal particulate matter to blow out.
    - Once ready, sterile tools and materials should be brought within the airflow after being surface-sterilised with a 70% alcohol spray.
    - Gloves should be worn and sterilised with 70% alcohol spray before beginning work.
    - HEPA filter should be replaced regularly according to manufacturer's instructions.

## Verification
Verification of sterility is performed according to 5BB routinely, or if a failure in aseptic conditions is observed in routine microbiology.

# S.O.P. 5BB Detailing Testing of Bunsen Burner or HEPA Sterility Assurance
## Preamble
To establish whether the bunsen flame is sufficient for creating a useful zone of work, or whether the airflow from the HEPA airflow system is sufficiently sterile, periodic testing should be performed, particularly if contamination is observed in the course of normal work.

## Aims
To perform a microbiologically-based assessment of HEPA/Bunsen sterility-assurance efficiency.

## Protocol
Testing the Bunsen Burner and the HEPA airflow follows the same procedure:

1. At least two fresh, sterile agar dishes should be brought into the zone of sterility.
2. At least one sterile petri dish should be left exposed to the zone of sterility for at least one minute.
3. After exposure, the plates should be sealed with porous masking tape, inverted and incubated for 7 days, observing daily for growth. If no growth is observed, adequacy of sterility is assumed.
4. If a reason for doubt is encountered, a full assay may be performed, with time-points from time of exposure over multiple agar dishes, compared with positive control plates exposed to normal lab air on the bench.
5. A comparison should then be made between the time needed for spontaneous inoculation of control and testing plates. If there is no clear benefit to the bunsen or HEPA after testing, they should be carefully maintained or replaced.

## Verification
As detailed above, the use of negative and if necessary positive controls will assure that the results reflect the proper function of the bunsen or HEPA.




# S.O.P. 5BC Detailing Correct Maintenance of Bunsen Burners and HEPA Filters
## Preamble
Bunsen Burners are generally reliable, solid-state devices and need little direct maintenance. When they do, it is most likely to involve the valve pin or tuning screw. HEPA Air Filters gradually wear through a filter cartridge as dust and other filtered particles adhere to the micro-fibers within. These filters need occasional replacement.

## Aims
As both items of equipment are being used within manufacturer's parameters, and to the intended aims of the manufacturer, the manufacturer's maintenance and repair instructions are appropriate. As models differ, so will repair or maintenance instructions; for this reason, no specific protocol is needed here.

## Protocol
Maintenance of both items of equipment should be performed according to manufacturer instructions.

## Verification
Testing according to SOP 5BB should be performed after any repair or maintenance to test for efficacy.

# S.O.P. 5CA Detailing Proper Usage of Fridge or Freezer Equipment
## Preamble
Fridge/Freezers are fairly foolproof in their operation as refrigeration devices. However, design-specific considerations become relevant when using them for microbiological containment.

## Aims
To account for design constraints or conditions when using standard fridge/freezer appliances for storage of GMM microbes.

## Protocol
1. Fridge cooling elements are often placed behind the back wall of the fridge unit, and condensation will form readily on this surface and flow down. To catch this condensation, an inner shelf with a rear drain is now a common feature of domestic fridges.
    - To account for the minor risk of GMM escape through this drain, GMM-microbe samples are not to be kept at a level above the drain.
    - The collection compartment for the drain, if present, should be pre-loaded with a long-lasting biocide (such as CuSO4) in order to destroy possible runoff bacteria. Inorganic biocide should be removed from outgoing waste before disposal; CuSO4 can be removed by precipitating copper onto iron nails, for example. This should be performed after autoclave sterilisation of the runoff.
2. Freezer compartments may employ anti-frost mechanisms in order to prevent the exposed elements from becoming coated in frost, impairing efficiency. For storage of microbial samples in the freezer, this may pose a hazard of culture loss as the freezer coil temporarily warms.
    - Samples should be kept away from the element where possible.
    - Preferably, cultures should be insulated from the surrounding freezer (once they have frozen solidly) with cold-packs or cloth insulation.
3. Fridge/freezer units should be kept securely closed when not in use, and time spent with the door opened should be minimised.
4. A freezer-thermometer should be used at least occasionally to verify the temperatures within are 4C for the fridge, and -20C for the freezer.

## Verification
Verification is detailed in 5CB.

# S.O.P. 5CB Detailing Testing or Validation of the Fridge/Freezer
## Preamble
Testing of a Fridge-Freezer is performed as an ongoing, evidential process. Freezer thermometers are used to assay the fridge/freezer for correct operational temperatures.

Microbiological swabbing of the freezer is also performed whenever maintaining the freezer, taking samples before and after the cleaning is performed.

## Aims
To outline parameters for temperature testing and temperature variability analysis.

## Protocol
1. To monitor temperatures, a freezer thermometer is used. The thermometer may be used periodically to spot-check the fridge/freezer, and should be used as follows:
    - The chamber to be tested is opened and the sensor put inside, with the display wired outside.
    - The chamber is closed and allowed to reach normal inner temperature for an hour.
    - The reading is then taken and logged with a timestamp. If further testing is desired, follow on:
    - The chamber door is opened again for one minute to allow the temperature to rise. This should not be done while samples are still stored within, or damage may occur.
    - The door is then closed, a reading and timestamp taken, and another timestamped reading is taken every ten minutes for the next hour.
    - If the temperature has not yet reached the normal inner temperature, proceed as necessary.
    - If the temperature undershoots (overcompensates), this should be recorded until the temperature settles at the ideal level.
2. To test the fridge/freezer for microbiological residues before and after maintainance, the inner surfaces should be swabbed with a sterile swab and streaked on rich agar media. Suggested surfaces include:
    - The rear wall and drain
    - The lowest shelf
    - The freezer chamber
    - The lower door shelf
    - The higher door shelf
3. These swabs should be streaked on quartered dishes, labelled, and duplicated after cleaning.

## Verification
The temperature logs should indicate whether the fridge/freezer is properly attaining and maintaining the target temperatures. More intensive testing may reveal how long it takes the fridge/freezer to cool the inner chambers.

Assuming this testing is performed during general maintainance and the fridge is empty, this can act as a measure of fridge/freezer function and efficiency; if a change is observed in the cooling profile of an unloaded freezer in a room of approximately the same ambient temperature, it is possible that the fridge is becoming less effective with wear.

Culture growth before and after cleaning should be observed. If cultures resembling lab strains grow, they should be PCR-tested for the presence of GM-materials. If no unusual growths are observed and the level of growth is diminished or obviated after proper cleaning, the cleaning process is deemed successful.

# S.O.P. 5CC Detailing Proper Maintenance of Fridge/Freezer Equipment
## Preamble
This protocol more properly details proper cleaning and sterilisation of fridge/freezer surfaces and compartments. Maintenance of the equipment itself should be performed as detailed in the manuals or by a skilled contractor or by the manufacturer.

## Aims
To defrost, surface-clean, and surface-sterilise the Fridge/Freezer unit.

## Protocol
1. The fridge/freezer should be emptied of all contents.
    - Freezer-contents, including enzymes and long-term culture stores, should be kept in a polystyrene container with ice-packs to maintain a freezing internal temperature. A freezer thermometer should be used to monitor this temporary storage.
    - Fridge contents which cannot tolerate temporary room temperature should likewise be stored in polystyrene with cooling packs.
2. The fridge/freezer should then be plugged out and left to defrost with disposable towelling for absorbtion of frost.
3. The fridge/freezer surfaces should be swabbed according to SOP 5CB for microbiological testing.
4. Inner surfaces should be sprayed with 70% alcohol, left for 30 seconds, and then wiped clean with disposable towelling. Towelling should be collected in heat-resistant bags for autoclaving.
5. Surfaces should then be sprayed with a non-corrosive commercial surface disinfectant and allowed to act according to the product instructions.
6. Surfaces should then be dried with disposable towelling, and swabbed again for testing as in (3).
7. The fridge/freezer should then be plugged back in and allowed to attain ideal inner temperature before re-loading. If possible, the temperature of both inner compartments should be observed and logged during this period in order to observe the Fridge/Freezer for proper, effective cooling.

## Verification
Microbiological testing as performed according to 5CB will assist in verifying efficient cleaning.

# S.O.P. 5DA Detailing Usage of an Oven for Dry Heat Sterilisation
## Preamble
Although moist heat is best used for sterilisation of disposables, media and waste products (including GMM waste), temperature-resistant glassware and many metalware lab containers or tools may be sterilised more easily with dry heat. This may be advantageous for glassware such as petri-dishes for example, where dry heat avoids waterstaining and condensation, making it easier to pour separately sterilised agar media. As larger loads may also be sterilised in this way, it can be more economical and less labour intensive. However, long cycles are required, and expediency may still call for moist-heat sterlisation of glassware in some cases.

## Aims
To detail the correct preparation, loading and sterilisation by dry heat of glassware or metal items.

## Protocol
1. Items to be sterilised should be clean and free of dirt, and drained of washing-water as fully as possible.
2. Items should be wrapped in aluminium foil in order to permit heat penetration during sterilisation while preventing the ensuing penetration of dust or contaminated air. No tape of any sort should be used to seal the foil, as this could cause a fire within the oven.
3. Items should be placed in an ambient temperature oven in the middle shelf area. Preferably a fan-assisted oven is used.
4. The oven door should be closed and sealed with heat-resistant tape to prevent accidental opening during cycling (which could lead to glassware shattering). Kapton tape is ideal.
5. The oven should then be set to 220C and allowed to come to full temperature.
6. Once full temperature has been reached, the glassware should be allowed to sterilise for two hours.
7. The oven should then be deactivated and allowed to cool completely.
8. The glassware should be left in the sealed oven for a further hour to allow it to slowly equilibriate.
9. Glassware should now be sterile provided the wrapping is only opened under sterile conditions thereafter.

## Verification
As performed in 5DB.

# S.O.P. 5DB Detailing Validation of Dry Heat Sterilisation
## Preamble
Validation of dry heat sterilisation could be performed simply by placing a culture tube whose innards had been rinsed in live cultures into the oven. However, this would probably permanently stain/damage the glassware tube with caramelised, burned cellular matter.

Instead, it is more prudent to do the same with a piece of disposable foil, and to attempt to culture bacterial specimens from this sample instead.

## Aims
To test the oven for proper dry heat sterilisation using an inoculated sample of aluminium foil.

## Protocol
1. A piece of aluminium foil should be wrapped tightly around a thin rod or pen, to create a cylinder that can be easily slipped into a test tube.
2. The foil cylinder should then be inoculated with live cultures, preferably of a stationary phase culture of Bacillus sp.
3. Another foil cylinder should be prepared under sterile conditions after alcohol-sterilisation, and will be used as a negative control for growth.
4. The foil should be allowed to drip and air dry. It should then be placed in a glass test tube, and the tube capped with foil or metal slip-caps (i.e. Cap-O-Test caps).
5. Sterilisation should be performed according to 5DA.
6. To the sterilised tube, sterile, clear rich broth should be added under sterile conditions.
7. The tube should first be observed for cloudiness after addition of broth, due either to flaking foil or burned residues. If there is any cloudiness at this stage, it should be noted and observed for settling in the next few hours, in order to distinguish it from true growth after incubation overnight.
8. The tube should then be incubated at 30C for 7 days and observed for growth daily. If any growth is observed in the test foil tube and not in the control foil tube, this may indicate insufficient heat, time or poor preparation for the sterilisatoin cycle, and parameters must be adjusted to account for this failure.

## Verification
As above.

# S.O.P. 5DC Detailing Maintenance of the Sterilisation Oven
## Preamble
Besides inner surface sterilisation of the oven with disinfectant spray (when the oven is plugged out), other elements of oven maintenance should be carried out according to manufacturer's instructions, deferring to licensed contractors or the manufacturers as appropriate.

## Aims
None: Maintenance is best performed according to instructions, or by contractors or manufacturers. Surface sterilisation by commercial disinfectant should be performed regularly and before maintenance.

## Protocol
None.

## Verification
None.

# S.O.P. 5E Detailing Testing and Maintenance of Lab Surfaces
## Preamble
Inasmuch as “containment” is considered a holistic, ongoing operation involving GMMs, the surfaces on which work is conducted should rightly be considered “containment equipment”. 

However, surfaces hardly require concise instructions on use, and testing and maintenance are straightforward enough to share the same document.

## Aims
To detail microbiological testing of lab surfaces.
To detail general care and maintenance of lab surfaces.

## Protocol
1. In keeping with good microbiological practice, microbiology is only practised on chemically resistant surfaces. For this definition of “chemically resistant”, most new laminated MDF board benches are sufficient.
2. The benches should be kept clean of residues or dirt, and should be wiped down at least weekly during periods of use with commercial disinfectant. During and after periods of work with Bacilli or other spore-forming species, they should also be sprayed weekly with a peroxide solution. Before use and after use, they should be likewise sprayed down with 70% alcohol spray. All sprays should be allowed sufficient contact time to kill cells or spores.
3. If damage is inflicted on the surface of the bench, it should be filled as soon as possible with a chemically resistent resin, which should be allowed to cure completely before work recommences.

## Verification
The lab benches may be tested for general sterility by swabbing and microbiological culture on rich media. If colonies are isolated from the lab bench, they may be tested for the presence of GM DNA with PCR if there is reason to suspect that the colonies represent lab cultures.

If colonies are isolated from the bench, procedures for sterilisation should be revised to improve sterilisation techniques.

# S.O.P. 5F Detailing Correct Operation of the Lab Centrifuges
## Preamble
Centrifuges are not directly used to contain organisms, but in the course of their use accidents may occur which would lead to a loss of containment. To ward against this possibility, centrifuges should be used with great care when handling GMM material (and indeed, at all other times).

## Aims
To detail general procedures when operating centrifuges which can help to minimise the risk of centrifuge failure or accidents which might lead to personal harm or a loss of containment.

## Protocol
1. Centrifuges, driver motors, power supplies or CNC controls may come with instruction manuals that detail safe usage and proper operation parameters; these should be followed first, over and above the following guidelines, to account for possible differences in operational use between models.
2. Centrifuges require complete balance in order to operate safely; to this end, tubes should be loaded by precise weight rather than the appearance of equal volume. A milligram balance should be used to confirm that the weights of opposing samples match as closely together as can be practically achieved.
3. Centrifuges that are not specifically designed for long-term use should not be used continuously.
4. Centrifuges without refidgeration should not be operated long-term on the same samples, in order to prevent overheating or vapourisation of samples.
5. Centrifuges should be operated on stable surfaces, and should preferably be tethered or attached to stable anchor points to prevent them from moving in use or falling.
6. Centrifuges should not be operated while there is anything in the vicinity which may:
    - Enter the rotor or rotor chamber, if possible.
    - Enter or occlude any air intakes.
    - Obstruct any exhaust vents.
    - Short circuit or otherwise interfere with the electronics within the centrifuge. (It bears consideration that the high-power brushed DC motor in an average centrifuge may itself pose an interference hazard to other items of lab equipment)
7. Centrifuges should not be opened while the rotor is still spinning.
8. If a centrifuge motor can or should be oiled according to manufacturer instructions, it may be advisable to oil with a slightly increased regularity over the recommended amount. Good quality, heat resistant oil should be used; greases designed for slower motors may not withstand frictional heating as effectively.

## Verification
Verification is inappropriate for safeguards against centrifuge failure. However, a continuing process of evaluation should be applied to the protocols above, and improvements implemented as they are devised or discovered.
