# S.O.P. Detailing Staff and Visitor Training
## Preamble
To ensure compliance with the terms of consent as granted by the EPA, all persons conducting work (whether professionally or as part of a training programme) in the lab must have training in areas of Good Microbiological Practice, Good Occupational Safety and Hygiene, and the legal requirements of the “Genetically Modified Organisms (Contained Use) Regulations 2001 and 2010”. 

This document lays out the requirements of such training and means to verify appropriate understanding of the training regimen.

# Aims
To bring new visitors or staff to a level of competency enabling safe GMM handling, manipulation and storage in the lab. To maintain good habits and an increasing level of competency.

# Protocol
1. A list of specific requirements of GMP and GOSH will be printed and placed prominently on the wall of the lab. Handouts containing information on GMP, GOSH, general and specific compliance conditions levied on this lab will be provided.
2. A course of theoretical considerations will be provided prior to entry to the lab or commencement of practical work. This course will include:
    - Theory of Biotechnology, including DNA, enzymes, gene transfer.
    - Theory of Microbiology, including growth, respiration, sporulation, death.
    - Legal frameworks surrounding GMM use in Ireland.
    - Methods of validating and improving handling and containment practices.
    - The content and intent of all SOPs used in the lab.
3. Participants will be guided through practical microbiology work with non-GM microbes in order to gain competence with growth, containment and disposal procedures.
4. Participants will be assessed by scenario modelling and question-and-answer sessions prior to commencement of GMM handling, growth, storage or disposal.
5. When a contained-use activity commences for a trainee or staff member, a record is placed in a digital logbook in the following format:
    - Date
    - Name of the individual
    - Age of the individual
    - Role in the lab: Trainee, Staff or Visitor/Resident
    - Verification of full training in accordance with this SOP
    - Nature of the activity (For Trainees and Visitors/Residents only)
    - Expected duration of activity (as above)
    - Assent of the individual to abide by SOPs and Legal Framework
    - Signature of individual

# Verification
Scenario modelling will be used to assess understanding of safe procedures. Where understanding is imperfect corrections will be offered and expanded detail given on the reasoning behind measures and standards.

Individuals will be observed during work on non-GM organisms once admitted to the lab, and will be corrected or assisted where unable to meet requirements successfully. If individuals are incapable of correctly handling non-GM organisms, they will not be permitted to handle or interact with GM materials.

Individuals who are unable to meet basic safety requirements will not be permitted to enter or continue work in the laboratory.
