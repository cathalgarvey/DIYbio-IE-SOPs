# S.O.P. 8 Detailing Risk Assessment Protocol
## Preamble
Risk assessment underpins the containment practises used in this lab. Therefore, a rigorous method of risk assessment is critical to ongoing responsible containment.

## Aims
To outline methods of holistically assessing risks associated with the design, creation and containment of genetically modified organisms within the lab.

## Protocol
1. In order to better assess incidental risks of genetic modification, it is wise to consider the final, modified organism as if it were a separate strain or species from the donor and recipient species or strains.
2. Available literature detailing pathogenicity to humans is the primary concern when assessing the risks of donor or recipient strains. Sources of information include:
    - Comprehensive searches in the pubmed/scholar databases of literature abstracts for cases of infection, whether primary or opportunistic, using strain-specific keywords, bearing in mind that strain and species names can change dramatically over time, often without homogenous uptake of new strain names by existing labs.
    - Legal documents detailing biosafety levels should be consulted; species with a biosafety rating of 3-4 should never be considered for culture, and almost never considered as sources of DNA for transgenic experimentation. Species with a biosafety rating of 2 may be considered as sources of genetic novelty provided the DNA is of an entirely inocuous type; routine cellular processing enzymes, for example, or marker-DNA only. Species with a rating of Biosafety level 1 cannot be relied upon to be entirely inocuous either, as species possessing minor toxins or allergic qualities may still be found within this category.
    - Genome data revealing relatedness to pathogenic species. This is considered case-by-case, as many species have a high inter-strain variation and may have examples of symbiotic, parasitic and benign strains within the same species.
    - Compatibility of mobile DNA elements with pathogenic species and the results of such crossovers in primary research literature.
    - Incidence of allergic responses to the strains or to their extracts.
    - Incidence of toxic compounds produced by the strains.
3. If any pathogenicity, allergenicity or toxicity is apparent in either donor or recipient strain, it should be carefully determined whether the transfer of DNA from one to the other has any bearing on this; whether, for example, the transferred DNA can conceivably play a role in the trait concerned. Even among the worst pathogenic species, a sizeable majority of the genetic material concerns itself with routine cell maintainance and replication, and has no bearing on pathogenicity. Examples of novel genes that are often found in pathogenic species, but which carry little or no pathogenic hazard, include restriction enzymes, polymerases, and bacteriocins.
4. The growth range or habitat of the two strains should be considered as a factor in potential for GMM escape. “Lab Strain” bacteria are frequently incapable of survival outside laboratory conditions, but this should not overshadow the need for a comprehensive analysis of escape potential, particularly if conferred traits might increase survival odds.
5. The function of the DNA should be carefully considered. If the DNA is foreseen or planned to add traits to the species that do not already exist in the species:
    - Do these traits improve or detriment the strain's ability to compete or survive in its usual environment?
    - Do these traits confer the ability to survive in a novel habitat?
    - Do these traits improve the general fitness of the organism?
    - Do these traits permit or assist in surviving articial selection conditions, for example medically administered antibiotics, or sterilants used for containment of GMMs within the lab?
6. Are the traits transferable to other strains or species? What host range do the mobile DNA elements support? What possibility of transfer to other such strains exists:
    - Within normal laboratory conditions?
    - Within normal storage conditions?
    - Within forseeable, immediate escape conditions? (For example, outside the lab)
7. If the resulting GMM were to escape laboratory containment, what forseeable negative consequences could result - 
    - If the species were assumed to be fully viable and competitive
    - If the modified DNA were assumed to be made available to other wild organisms
    - If the modified DNA were adopted and employed by common human pathogens
    - If the modified DNA were adopted by agriculturally important pest species or
    - If the species were assumed able to infect a human or animal host
8. In the interest of worst-case scenario modelling, are there any uses to which the DNA or GMM could be put, if stolen, which would be:
    - Illegal
    - Dangerous to others or
    - Dangerous to the environment

## Verification
The above considerations should be discussed with the biological safety committee in advance of any proposed experiment.

If any concerns arise that cannot be addressed through experimental design, and if these concerns are concrete enough to raise the projected risk of the experiment outside the bracket of Level 1 Containment, the experiment should be abandoned. Any biological materials or DNA that had been designed or prepared up to this point should be either stored securely in aseptic conditions, or destroyed.
